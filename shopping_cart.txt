4) Make a carted products create action. Assume the user is sending the product_id and quantity as the only parameters.

5) Add an Insomnia request to add items to the cart (the carted products create action). (This will crash unless you provide the JWT in the headers...)

6) Make a carted products index action. Note that this shouldn’t show ALL the carted products - it should only display the current user’s carted products that have a status of “carted”!

7) Add an Insomnia request to view the shopping cart (the carted products index action). (This will crash unless you provide the JWT in the headers...)

8) Change the orders create action to do the following:
i) Find all of the current user’s carted products that have a status of “carted”.
ii) Use that data to create a new row in the orders table, and save the user_id, subtotal, tax, and total.
iii) Modify all the rows from the carted_products table so that their status changes to “purchased” and that they are given the appropriate order_id.

9) Add an Insomnia request to purchase all items in the shopping cart (the orders create action) (This will crash unless you provide the JWT in the headers...)

10) Add a carted products destroy action. This shouldn’t destroy the carted product - it should instead just update the status to “removed”.
